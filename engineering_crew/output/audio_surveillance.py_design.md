# Detailed Design of `audio_surveillance.py` Module

## Overview

The `audio_surveillance.py` module is implemented to meet the high-level requirements outlined for a surveillance platform's audio ingestion and analysis capabilities. It is a self-contained module supporting audio uploads, metadata extraction, event searching, metadata visualization, report generation, and integration with existing surveillance systems across various audio formats and qualities.

## `AudioSurveillance` Class

The `AudioSurveillance` class represents the main component responsible for handling the lifecycle of audio files within the surveillance system. Key operations include uploading audio files, extracting metadata, searching events, visualizing metadata, and generating reports.

### Class: `AudioSurveillance`

#### `__init__(self)`

- Initializes resources such as temporary storage, processing configurations, and any necessary integrations with existing systems.

#### `upload_audio(self, file_path: str) -> bool`

- Uploads an audio file for analysis.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `file_path`: Path to the audio file.
- **Returns**: 
  - Boolean indicating success or failure of the upload.

#### `extract_metadata(self, file_path: str) -> dict`

- Extracts metadata from an audio file, including duration, sample rate, and channels.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `file_path`: Path to the audio file.
- **Returns**: 
  - Dictionary containing metadata details.

#### `search_events(self, keywords: List[str], file_path: str) -> List[Tuple[float, float]]`

- Allows users to search for specific events within the audio files based on key phrases or sounds.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `keywords`: List of keywords or phrases to search.
  - `file_path`: Path to the audio file.
- **Returns**: 
  - List of tuples, each representing a start and end time for an event.

#### `visualize_metadata(self, metadata: dict) -> None`

- Provides a way to visualize the extracted metadata.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `metadata`: Dictionary containing metadata details to visualize.

#### `generate_report(self, file_path: str, metadata: dict, events: List[Tuple[float, float]]) -> str`

- Generates a report based on the analyzed audio files.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `file_path`: Path to the audio file.
  - `metadata`: Metadata dictionary.
  - `events`: List of detected events.
- **Returns**: 
  - String representing the path to the generated report.

#### `integrate_with_system(self) -> None`

- Contains logic to ensure integration with existing surveillance systems.

### Helpers and Utilities

#### `_process_large_files(self, file_path: str) -> str`

- Optimizes handling of large audio files by possibly chunking the files or utilizing streaming methods.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `file_path`: Path to the audio file.
- **Returns**: 
  - Modified path or reference to the processed file.

#### `_handle_multiple_formats(self, file_path: str) -> None`

- Ensures compatibility with various audio formats, sample rates, channels, bit depths, compression formats, metadata, encoding, and codecs.
  
## Conclusion

The `audio_surveillance.py` module is designed to offer robust and efficient functionalities for the comprehensive management of audio files in a surveillance context. These capabilities ensure that users can effectively upload, analyze, and manage audio files across a wide array of formats and parameters.
