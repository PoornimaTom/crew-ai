# EngineeringCrew Crew

## Project Overview

EngineeringCrew Crew is a template for building multi-agent AI systems using [crewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/en/installation). This project orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents—such as architects, backend engineers, frontend engineers, and QA engineers—to collaboratively solve complex engineering tasks. Each agent is configurable and can be assigned specific roles, tools, and goals, allowing for flexible automation and intelligent task execution.

The system is designed for extensibility, making it easy to add new agents, tasks, and custom logic. You can define agent behaviors and task flows using YAML configuration files, and leverage crewAI's orchestration features to maximize productivity and collaboration.

## Installation

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Python >=3.10 and <3.14
   - [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management
   - (Optional) Docker, if you want agents to execute code in isolated environments

2. **Install UV:**
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   Navigate to your project directory and run:
   ```bash
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Or, if using crewAI CLI:
   ```bash
   crewai install
   ```

4. **Set up Environment Variables:**
   - Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` to a `.env` file in the project root.

5. **Configure Agents and Tasks:**
   - Edit `src/engineering_crew/config/agents.yaml` to define your agents
   - Edit `src/engineering_crew/config/tasks.yaml` to define your tasks

## Deployment & Running

To deploy and run your crew of AI agents:

1. From the root folder, start the crew:
   ```bash
   crewai run
   ```
   This will initialize the EngineeringCrew, assemble the agents, and execute the tasks as defined in your configuration files.

2. Outputs (such as reports or results) will be generated in the project directory, as specified by your task configuration.

## Customization

- Modify `src/engineering_crew/crew.py` to add custom logic, tools, or agent/task arguments.
- Update `src/engineering_crew/main.py` to provide custom inputs or orchestrate advanced workflows.

## About

EngineeringCrew Crew is designed to help you harness the power of multi-agent AI collaboration for engineering and automation tasks. Get started quickly, customize to your needs, and scale your AI workflows with ease.

**How to fix:**

1. **Add a `researcher` agent method to your class:**

````python
    @agent
    def researcher(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
            config=self.agents_config['researcher'], # type: ignore[index]
            verbose=True
        )
````

2. **Make sure your `agents_config` includes a `'researcher'` entry.**

3. **If you don't need a researcher agent, remove references to `'researcher'` from your tasks config.**

**Summary:**  
Either define the missing `researcher` agent, or update your configuration to remove it from the list of required agents for tasks.

An error occurred while running the crew: Command '['uv', 'run', 'run_crew']' returned non-zero exit status 1.

GitHub Copilot: Let's break down your error and how to fix it:

## Error Summary

The key error is:

```
RuntimeError: Docker is not running. Please start Docker to use code execution with agent: An engineer with python coding skills who can write unit tests for the given backend module {module_name}
```

This is triggered because the `crewai` library is trying to run code in a Docker container, but Docker is not running on your machine.

## Why this happens

- The `crewai` agent is configured to use code execution, which relies on Docker.
- When it tries to check Docker status (`docker info`), it fails because Docker is not running (or not installed).
- The error bubbles up and stops your script.

## How to fix

### 1. **Start Docker**

If you have Docker installed, make sure it's running:

- On Mac: Open the Docker Desktop app.
- On Linux: Run `sudo systemctl start docker` or similar.
- On Windows: Open Docker Desktop.

Then, verify in your terminal:

```bash
docker info
```

If you see info about your Docker installation, it's running.

### 2. **Install Docker (if not installed)**

If you don't have Docker:

- [Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- Install and start it.

### 3. **Check Permissions**

If you get a permissions error, you may need to add your user to the `docker` group (Linux):

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
Then log out and back in.

### 4. **Disable Docker Requirement (if you don't need code execution)**

If your agent doesn't need code execution, you can configure it to not require Docker. Check your agent definition in `crew.py` and see if you can set `code_execution=False` or remove code execution features.

Example:

```python
Agent(
    ...,
    code_execution=False,  # or remove this argument
)
```

## Summary

- **Start Docker** and rerun your script.
- If you don't need Docker, disable code execution in your agent config.

---

**If you need more help:**  
Paste your agent definition from `crew.py` and I can show you exactly how to disable Docker/code execution.

KeyError: 'frontend_engineer'
An error occurred while running the crew: Command '['uv', 'run', 'run_crew']' returned non-zero exit status 1.

GitHub Copilot: The error message you provided is:

```
KeyError: 'frontend_engineer'
```

**Where does it occur?**
- In your code: `config=self.agents_config['frontend_engineer']`
- File: `/src/engineering_crew/crew.py`, line 43

**What does it mean?**
- Your code is trying to access the key `'frontend_engineer'` in the dictionary `self.agents_config`.
- That key does **not exist** in the dictionary, so Python raises a `KeyError`.

---

## How to Fix

### 1. Check your `agents_config`
- Find where `self.agents_config` is defined (likely in your `EngineeringCrew` class or a config file).
- Make sure it includes an entry for `'frontend_engineer'`.

**Example:**
```python
self.agents_config = {
    'frontend_engineer': {
        # ... config options ...
    },
    # other agents...
}
```

### 2. If you use a config file (YAML, JSON, etc.)
- Open your config file.
- Make sure it has a section for `frontend_engineer`.

**Example (YAML):**
```yaml
agents_config:
  frontend_engineer:
    # ... config options ...
  backend_engineer:
    # ... config options ...
```

### 3. If you don't need a `frontend_engineer`
- Check your code and tasks. If you don't need this agent, remove references to it from your code and config.

---

## Debugging Tips

- **Print your config:** Add a print statement before the error to see what keys are present.
    ```python
    print(self.agents_config.keys())
    ```
- **Check spelling:** Make sure there are no typos in `'frontend_engineer'` in both your code and config.

---

## Summary

**You need to add a `'frontend_engineer'` entry to your `agents_config` dictionary or config file.**  
If you already have it, check for typos or issues in how the config is loaded.
